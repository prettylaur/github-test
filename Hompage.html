                            <h3> Runway Magazine Work ethics</h3>
                            <h4> Posted by: Runway Magazine</h4>
                            
                            <h5>Focus and Persistence</h5>
                            <p>People with a good work ethic have the ability to stay focused on tasks for as long as necessary
                            to get them done. Building persistence will allow you to basically train yourself to work for 
                            longer periods of time while also working harder. It is important though, to balance persistence 
                            with adequate rest to reduce the risk of burnout. Focus is equally as important as persistence 
                            when it comes to work ethic. Focusing will allow you to finish tasks more efficiently while 
                            avoiding distractions.</p>
                            <h5> Finish Tasks in a Timely and Efficient Manner</h5>
                            <p> People with a strong work ethic do not procrastinate and instead immediately tackle their work
                            tasks. In addition to getting to tasks right away, a good work ethic involves doing things 
                            properly. Employers do not want to see sloppy and incorrect work and may question the work 
                            ethic of people who produce poor quality work.</p>
                            <h5>Always Be Punctual</h5>
                            <p>In order to make a good impression, you should always be punctual for school, 
                            work or appointments. Some people have a hard time getting out the door, so setting the 
                            clock ahead a few minutes or planning to leave the house extra early can help. Showing up
                            late for work can signal to employers that you are not devoted to your job.</p>

                        <h4>Posted by: Nigel</h4>
                        <p> When it comes to embarking on a workwear-friendly wardrobe overhaul,
                        shirting is a solid starting point. Look to soft materials to ease your way back into something 
                        resembling desk-side polish – we love styles from With Nothing Underneath and Margaret Howell – and
                        for those of us that are ready to embrace some form of structure (silhouettes, that is) then a trusty blazer 
                        is your hot-ticket to being stylish and smart without the fuss. On that note, for flattering cuts in creaseproof 
                        fabrics, make Edeline Lee your first port of call: her easy pieces, including a georgette top, £310, a belted 
                        jacquard skirt, £390 and a jacquard shopper bag, £300.</p>

                            <h3>How to get an interview at runway magazine</h3>
                            <h4>posted by Andy</h4>
                            
                            <h5>Do Your Homework</h5>
                            <p>A common mistake is not doing adequate research prior to the interview. “Many think they’ll learn 
                            about the company and the job when they get there, but if you wait that long, it’s a mistake,” says DeCarlo. Background 
                            information is key to tailor your responses to the employer’s needs and illustrate that you don’t just want a job, you want 
                            this job. The last thing you want to do is ask a question that could have easily been answered by performing a Google search 
                            or reading their “About Us” page. </p>
                            <h5>Practice, Practice, Practice</h5>
                            <p>Formulating answers to the most common interview questions will ensure you are neither at a loss for words nor long-winded.
                            “More preparation is always better,” says Big Interview cofounder Pamela Skillings. “No one ever said that they didn’t get the 
                            job because they practiced too much.” You’re all but guaranteed a “tell me a little bit about yourself” at the beginning of an 
                            interview, and according to experts, how well you answer this question is critical to set the right tone. Limit your response to
                            one to two minutes and get right to the point to keep it from sounding like a monologue. “Start strong with an opening statement 
                            that is a big picture of who you are in your career right now,” says Skillings, similar to how you would reply when someone asks 
                            what you do. Follow this up with a few key points of why you are an eligible candidate, such as work experience, promotions, and 
                            awards. Tailor it to the specific position and rehearse until it feels natural.</p>
